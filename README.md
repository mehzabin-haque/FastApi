### FastAPI Practice Code

This repository contains a simple FastAPI practice code to help you understand how FastAPI works and its basic functionalities.

## What is FastAPI?

FastAPI is a modern, fast, web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use, high-performance, and efficient. FastAPI allows you to quickly develop APIs with automatic validation, serialization, and documentation generation.

## How to Use this Code

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the FastAPI application using `python app.py`.
5. Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` in your browser to access the automatic API documentation and interact with the endpoints.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `app.py`: This is the main FastAPI application file containing the API endpoints.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the dependencies required for this project.

## Endpoints

The FastAPI application provides the following endpoints:

1. `GET /`: A welcome message indicating the API is running.
2. `GET /items/{item_id}`: Retrieves details of a specific item based on its ID.
3. `POST /items/`: Creates a new item with the provided data.
4. `PUT /items/{item_id}`: Updates an existing item based on its ID with the provided data.
5. `DELETE /items/{item_id}`: Deletes an item based on its ID.

## Contributing

If you find any issues or want to enhance the functionality, feel free to contribute by creating pull requests. Your contributions are welcome!
